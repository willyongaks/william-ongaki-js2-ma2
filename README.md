Level 1
Loop through the array and create one HTML list from each item in the array.* <done>
Add a button or icon to each item that removes that particular item from the array.
When there are no more items in the array display a message.


Level 2
Create the list from an empty array that you use a text input and button to add new objects to. The objects can have the same structure as the array from level 1.

Each item should have a button or icon that removes it from the array.

Save the list to and retrieve it from localStorage.
